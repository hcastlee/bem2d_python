# PyBem2d

## What is PyBem2d?

PyBem2d is a python module for 2D Boundary elements. It will evenually be used with HTOOL (https://github.com/htool-ddm/htool), Pierre Marchand's implementation of heirarchical matrices. Right now, it is in an early state of development, and is mostly a source of procrasination.

## Planned features
* Piecewise linear geometry
* 0th-order discontinuous basis functions
* 1st-order linear continuous basis functions
* Support for Laplace and Helmholtz equation (real and complex wavenumber)
* Example scripts to create H marices and solve them using gmres
